    ```
    This will start the backend server, making the application's API available.

### 3. Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Folder:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Start the Flutter Application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run -d chrome
    ```
    This will launch the application in Chrome browser.
